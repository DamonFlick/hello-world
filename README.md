# hello-world
I am a webdeveloper and .NET engineer who loves defining user-needs.  With experience working in Agile environments as a freelance developer and Scrum team member, I know development life-cycle. My approach is finding how best to serve a project and the people involved: Relationships, communication and competance are my language.

I also love to play and teach music! My years of experience in the music industry have taught me how to:
-Harmonize with a group
-Support the project instead of my ego
-Engage with single-minded focus
These skills have informed my coding workflow. Not only do I work well with others, I know how to be led. I've also found that both music and software-development depend on balancing theory and application. Relating 'documentation' to the piece at hand, knowing how to coach myself, and knowing when to ask for help are key skills I use often in both diciplines.

I am a graduate of The Tech Academyâ€™s Software Developer Boot Camp: trained and experienced in the following web and programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C# PHP, and more.

I am a full-stack developer and would love to work with you on your project!
